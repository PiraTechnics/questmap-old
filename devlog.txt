Developer Notes

- Secret_key is exposed by default, this is an issue. Fix as per: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64208678/hiding-secret-key-in-django-project-on-github-after-uploading-project

- NOTE: Django has a tool to generate random secret keys if needed. Run in shell:
	from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())

- We will also need to turn off debug mode in settings.py when ready to move to production (dw about this for now, just make note)

- Whenever we install a new dependency in our venv, make sure to update requirements.txt:
	pip install <whatever>
	pip freeze > requirements.txt

- Uninstalling apps is a pain in the ass. There's a process to follow, to ensure your files and database aren't FUBAR: https://www.delftstack.com/howto/django/django-remove-app/

- Got basic image uploading/display working, tho can only add/remove from admin panel. New 'maps' app added, will pare down notes to be separate app, should be able to see these on their own if possible
- Cleaned up Readme a bit

11/20/22
- Added Location Model, trying to figure out how to set the x and y of the location within the map (likely requires getting the x and y of a mouseclick, within an acceptable range)
 - Will need to start working with Javascript, to get client side stuff

 BIG updates:
 - Managed to implement coordinate discovery of spots on a given map, absolute to image properties. A location now has an x and y coordinate, stored in the database. When a map template loads, each location in the db that links to it populates an <area> that is clickable within 10 pixels.
 - Will need to keep in mind resizing for diff browsers, and test for that behavior. Should I look to imprelement unit tests etc?
 - Need to implement a way to add/remove/modify locations from the map view itself -- HOWEVER, this functionality should only be available to GMs. We may need an entirely separate view/template for this -- look into this when Users come into play

 12/1/22
 - Having removed original notes app, working at add 'notes' into maps app, which are atm simply text-log entries, timestamped and associated with a specific location. These should be displayed sequentially in each location's info page
 - Notes added as model, included in Location Template, and migrated into DB.
